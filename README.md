# Lean Six Sigma Green Belt Project  
## Reducing pH Variability in an Acid–Base Neutralization Process

### Project Overview
This project applies the Lean Six Sigma DMAIC framework to reduce outlet pH
variability in a continuous acid–base neutralization process operated in a
stirred tank reactor. Due to the nonlinear nature of pH control near neutrality,
small disturbances in flow rate, concentration, or mixing can lead to large
output deviations.

The objective was to identify key drivers of variability, improve process
capability, and establish statistical control using industry-standard quality
tools.

### Methodology
- DMAIC framework (Define–Measure–Analyze–Improve–Control)
- SIPOC and Voice of Customer (VOC) analysis
- Statistical Process Control (I–MR charts)
- Process capability analysis (Cp, Cpk)
- Full factorial Design of Experiments (DOE)
- ANOVA, main effects, and interaction analysis
- Confirmation runs and control charts

### Tools Used
- Minitab® Statistical Software
- Lean Six Sigma tools (SPC, DOE, capability analysis)

### Key Results
- Significant reduction in outlet pH variability
- Improvement in process capability (Cp and Cpk)
- Stable and controlled process under optimized conditions
